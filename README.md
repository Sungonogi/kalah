# Kalah Game

Kalah is a traditional two-player strategy board game, also known as "Mancala." This project is a digital version of the game, created for fun, with both a computer opponent and a human player mode. Check it out [here](https://ingosternberg.github.io/kalah/start).

## Project Overview

- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Inspiration**: This project was inspired by a Kalah Tournament at my university (FAU), where we were tasked with programming an AI to compete in the game.

## Features

- Interactive user interface built with Angular
- Computer opponent that calculates optimal moves using the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm
- Play against a computer or another player locally

## Rules of Kalah

The objective of Kalah is to capture as many seeds as possible. Players take turns picking seeds from one of their pits, distributing them counterclockwise, and aiming to capture the opponent’s seeds. If you're new to Kalah, don’t worry—jump right in and start playing to get the hang of it!

For more details on the rules, you can refer to the ["How to Play"](https://ingosternberg.github.io/kalah/tutorial) section on the website or read more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalah).
